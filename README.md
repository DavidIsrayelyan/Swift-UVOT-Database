# Swift-UVOT-Database
Here is presented analysed data of The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatories (Swift) UVOT tool. 
The Swift-UVOT tool provides simultaneous ultraviolet and optical data. The data has 
been analysed using fully automated Python package. The data are available for 
each source in a separate file, which columns are described below. 

Data has a tabular form, with the columns:

```shell
-Source Name : Name of the source.
-Observation ID : ID of the observation.
-MJD : Observation date in MJD format.
-RA (deg) : Right ascension of the observation in degrees.
-DEC (deg) : Declination of the observation in degrees.
-RA (hour) : Right ascension of the observation in hours.
-DEC (hour) : Declination of the observation in hours.
-U Magnitude : Calculated counts with the U filter in Magnitude with its error.
-B Magnitude : Calculated counts with the B filter in Magnitude with its error.
-V Magnitude : Calculated counts with the V filter in Magnitude with its error.
-W1 Magnitude : Calculated counts with the W1 filter in Magnitude with its error.
-W2 Magnitude : Calculated counts with the W2 filter in Magnitude with its error.
-M2 Magnitude : Calculated counts with the M2 filter in Magnitude with its error.
-U Flux : Calculated flux with the U filter in erg cm² s⁻¹ with its error.
-B Flux : Calculated flux with the B filter in erg cm² s⁻¹ with its error.
-V Flux : Calculated flux with the V filter in erg cm² s⁻¹ with its error.
-W1 Flux : Calculated flux with the W1 filter in erg cm² s⁻¹ with its error.
-W2 Flux : Calculated flux with the W2 filter in erg cm² s⁻¹ with its error.
-M2 Flux : Calculated flux with the M2 filter in erg cm² s⁻¹ with its error.
